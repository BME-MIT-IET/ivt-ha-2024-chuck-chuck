# Overview

The task is to achieve 100% coverage for ordered_stack and bitonic_sort.

## Summary of work performed
Wrote unit tests following best practices, used error assertion and rewrote the stack algorithm because of the error in the code.


## Results and Lessons Learned

Learned how to use unittest library for unit testing, including setup of the class to share between unittests, using assertion for errors.
Analize algorithm and find errors and correct them by making correct implementation of that algorithm. Adjusting and implementing unittest for 100% coverage.
