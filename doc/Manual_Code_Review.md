# Manual Code Review Documentation

## Overview

This document shows the findings from a manual code review conducted on selected portions of the code. The review aimed to identify common coding errors, ensure adherence to coding standards, and assess the overall quality of the code. The ultimate goal was to enhance the maintainability and reliability of the codebase.

## Methodology

The review was dont on the following files:
- `algorithms/tree/bst/kth_smallest.py`
- `algorithms/compression/huffman_coding.py`
- `algorithms/automata/dfa.py`

A check-list approach was adopted, utilizing a checklist to evaluate aspects such as:
- variable naming conventions
- code complexity
- adherence to the DRY principle,
- efficiency and documentation of the code
- etc.

## Main Results

### kth_smallest.py
- The initial implementation utilizes an in-order traversal with a stack, recognized for its space efficiency. The second version employs a recursive approach, constructing a list of node values with an O(n) space complexity, potentially less efficient for larger trees.
- Recommendations include enhancing the docstring to clearly show the method's functionality and parameters, ensuring a comprehensive understanding and proper usage of the method.

### huffman_coding.py
- The code is organized into well-defined classes (`Node`, `HuffmanReader`, `HuffmanWriter`, `TreeFinder`, `HuffmanCoding`), each responsible for distinct aspects of the Huffman coding process. This modular structure improves readability and maintainability.
- However, the documentation was found to be lacking. Additional comments in complex logic sections could significantly aid future maintenance efforts. Input validation for file paths and file content was recommended to prevent runtime errors.

### dfa.py
- The implementation effectively simulates a DFA, correctly processing input strings based on a given transition table and determining acceptance based on final states.
- It was noted that the function lacks input validation for transitions, start and final states, and input strings. Validating these inputs is crucial for robustness. Maintaining the Time Complexity at O(n) is suitable for DFA operations.

## Lessons Learned

This manual code review process highlighted several key points:
- The importance of regular code reviews to identify issues early and minimize technical debt.
- The significance of clear, descriptive naming conventions and thorough documentation for managing large codebases and facilitating future modifications.
- Common oversights in input validation and error handling were identified, highlighting their critical role in ensuring software reliability and stability.

This exercise showed the value of manual code reviews as an addition to automated testing, offering insights into the practical aspects of software development and maintenance.
