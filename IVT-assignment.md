# Project Summary

### Overview
The "Algorithms Project" is a collection of simple and neat examples that demonstrate how to use data structures and algorithms in Python 3. It covers various topics such as arrays, graphs, sorting methods, dynamic programming, mathematical operations, string manipulation, and tree/graph traversal techniques.

### Structure
The project contained in different folders based on the type of algorithms and data structures they implement and each folder contains multiple Python files, each focusing on a specific feature of the algorithm or data structure.

### Usage and Importance
The Algorithms acts as a public library that provides reusable codes which helps Python developers to easily understand and integrate the provided functionalities of Algorithms into their projects. It also can be used as a reference for learning algorithms, and solving coding problems.

# Goals of the Project
- Provide a large collection of Python implementations for data structures and algorithms.
- Offering clean code provide learning and understanding of different kind of algorithms.
- Resource for developers seeking to reusable algorithms and data structures in Python.
- Giving best practices in algorithm design, coding, and documentation.
- Inspire the developer to collaborate and contribute from the open-source community to keep improve and update the project in order to make it better.

# Selected Features for Further Work

### CI and static techniques
- Running a static analysis tool and reviewing the reported problems with SonarQube/SonarLint on a subset of the project and fix some part of the project based on the feedback given by the tools.

- Performing manual code review on some part of the application in GitHub.

### Testing

- Creating or extending unit tests using Python unittest.

- Measuring code coverage for tests and extending test suite based on the results using Python Coverage Library.

- Adding BDD tests using Cucumber testing tool.
